# OpenComputers-ServerInstaller
Makes Server-Client communication on the OpenComputers mode for Minecraft much easier.

Note: You should already know how to program in lua and have a basic understanding of OpenComputers. If you do not, watch this great official tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwkAKx-JwPs

In order to install, set up a working computer with an internet card and a wireless card.
Then, follow these steps:

	1. Download this repository onto a floppy disk in OpenComputers.
	2. Open the auto-mounted folder "ServerInstaller".
	3. Edit the server.lua file to your liking. (Descriptions of all of the functions that can be used are included in the /ServerInstaller/common/common.lua)
	4. Run duplicate (/ServerInstaller/duplicate.lua) to create an exact copy of the current disk onto another disk.
	5. Run install_server (/ServerInstaller/install_server.lua) to set-up your new server on another disk.
	6. Download the ClientInstaller repository for OpenComputers or create your own client.
